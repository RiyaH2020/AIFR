# AIFR
Age-invariant face Recognition aims at recognizing a person accurately regardless of changes in their appearance due to age or behavior.
It has become quite popular and has found applications in several fields such as criminal detection, security, and access-related applications.
 For carrying out the AIFR task, it is essential to use a comprehensive database with specific features
The models used for transfer learning are already trained using large datasets, and the weights learned are retained from the original training, which can change as per the application. Some modifications that are made to the model are: Freezing, discarding, or adding some layers. 
In this paper, we have compared the performance of three pre-trained models FaceNet, VGG-Face and OpenFace on two datasets: FG-NET and MORPH owing to their advantages. 
Published findings in the Springer Conference series.
