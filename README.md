# Age-Invariant Face Recognition (AIFR)  

This project explores **age-invariant face recognition (AIFR)**, which aims to recognize individuals accurately despite changes in appearance due to aging. AIFR has applications in **security, access control, and criminal detection**.  

##  My Contribution  
- Focused on adapting and evaluating the **VGG-Face model** for the AIFR task.  
- Applied **transfer learning** techniques by freezing and modifying layers.  
- Conducted experiments on the **FG-NET** and **MORPH** datasets to analyze performance.  

##  Results  
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of **VGG-Face** in handling age-related variations.  
- Provided comparative insights within the larger study that also considered FaceNet and OpenFace.  

##  Publication  
Published in the **Springer Conference Series**.  
- Title: *Age-Invariant Face Recognition using Transfer Learning*  
- Link: [Springer DOI / Conference Page]  


##  Key Insight  
Shows how **transfer learning with VGG-Face** can improve robustness in recognizing identities across age progression.
